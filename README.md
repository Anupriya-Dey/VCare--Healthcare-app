# VCare - A Healthcare App
## OVERVIEW
VCare  is  a  mobile  app  that  enables  healthcare  organizations  to  deliver  high-quality virtual  care,  boost  revenue  and  
increase  patient  satisfaction.  Both doctors  and  patients can  keep  track  of  their  appointments  and  communicate  directly through call or messaging.  
Importance of this app was realized especially during covid times, when physically meeting up with doctor was difficult.
Small problems could be solved in distance without standing in queues. Also people devoid of high quality facilities can meet good doctors remotely.
